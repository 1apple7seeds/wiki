## ssh to Jenny
In order to be able to compile the repositories in Jenny, you need to add the following to your /etc/hosts file:

```
192.168.1.101 cob3-1-pc1
192.168.1.102 cob3-1-pc2
192.168.1.103 cob3-1-pc3
```

To ssh to Jenny:
```
ssh -X username@cob3-1-pc#
```

where `username` should be replaced by the username of the workstation you are using and `#` by the pc number in Jenny that you want to access. See also [Aliases](aliases)

Now you can follow the instructions in the README files `mas_common_robotics`. For @home you should do the same with the README of `mas_domestic_robotics` and for @work the README in `mas_industrial_robotics`.
