# GitGate

# Workstation

In order to adjust the settings to all PCs on Jenny, you need at least four terminals open in your laptop.

## Overview
1. Generate a ssh key in your workstation.
2. Look at the [Aliases](development/setup/aliases) section.
3. Connect via ssh to each of the PCs by using `cob1`, `cob2`, `cob3`.
4. Create on each PC in directory _~/.ssh/_ a file called _authorized_keys_.
5. Copy the public part of your ssh key into the authorized_keys-file of each PC.

### 1. Generate a ssh key in your workstation
```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

### 2. Look at the [Aliases](development/setup/aliases) section

### 3. Connect via ssh to each of the PCs by using `cob1`, `cob2`, `cob3`

### 4. Create _authorized\_keys_-files
Execute in each of the PCs the following code in order to create the _authorized\_keys_-file at the right place.
```bash
$ touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### 5. Copy the public part of your ssh key into authorized_keys-files of each PC

Being in the terminal of your workstation execute the following lines of code (**Note: _username_ needs to be replaced by your own username**).
After each line you will need to enter your individual password one last time.

```bash
$ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@cob3-1-pc1:~/.ssh/authorized_keys

$ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@cob3-1-pc2:~/.ssh/authorized_keys

$ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@cob3-1-pc3:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
